# Lesson 6 – Risk, Impact, and Recommendations

## Incident Impact
The incident involved unauthorized access to a user account, resulting in exposure of sensitive personal and banking information.

## Risk Assessment
- Likelihood: Medium, due to credential compromise and the lack of additional authentication controls.
- Impact: High, because sensitive personal and financial information was accessed, creating potential financial loss, privacy violations, and loss of user trust.

## Why This Incident Matters
This incident demonstrates how compromised credentials can quickly lead to access to highly sensitive information. Even though the incident affected a single account, similar weaknesses could be exploited on a larger scale if not addressed.

## Security Recommendations
- Enable multi-factor authentication to reduce the risk of credential-based attacks.
- Improve login monitoring to detect unusual login behavior such as geographic anomalies or repeated failed attempts.
- Implement user security awareness training to reduce the likelihood of credential compromise.

## Executive Summary (Non-Technical)
This incident resulted in unauthorized access to sensitive user information due to compromised credentials. While the attack was limited to a single account, it highlights the need for stronger authentication controls and improved monitoring to reduce future risk.
