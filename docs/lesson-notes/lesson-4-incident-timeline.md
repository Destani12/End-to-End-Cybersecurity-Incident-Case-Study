# Lesson 4 – Incident Timeline Basics

## What an Incident Timeline Is 
An incident timeline shows the order of events so analysts can understand how an incident started and progressed.

## Example Timeline
- Event 1: Attacker successfully logs into the victim’s computer system.
- Event 2: Attacker accesses the victim’s email account and reviews stored messages.
- Event 3: Attacker obtains sensitive information and uses it to access the victim’s bank account.

## Why Timelines Matter in Investigations
- Each step can be tied to evidence
- A timeline is proves what happens its not a guess

## Questions I Have
- “Who would a DFIR analyst report to?”
