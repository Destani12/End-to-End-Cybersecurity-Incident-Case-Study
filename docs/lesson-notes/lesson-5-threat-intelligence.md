# Lesson 5 – Threat Intelligence & MITRE ATT&CK

## What Threat Intelligence Means 
Threat intelligence helps defenders understand common attacker behaviors so they can better detect and prevent incidents.

## Attacker Actions in This Incident
- Attacker logged into the system using compromised credentials.
- Attacker accessed the victim’s email account.
- Attacker collected and stole sensitive information.


## How This Helps Defenders
- Threat Intelligence and MITRE ATT&CK help defenders identify, classify, and anticipate attacker behavior by mapping observed activity to known tactics and techniques. This enables improved detection logic, faster response, better alert prioritization, and more effective communication across security teams.

## Questions I Have
- Do DFIR analysts use MITRE ATT&CK when determining an attacker’s timeline?
