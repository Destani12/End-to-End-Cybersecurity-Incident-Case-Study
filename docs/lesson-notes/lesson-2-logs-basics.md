# Lesson 2 – Logs Basics

## What Logs Are 
Logs are records that systems automatically create to track actions like logins, failures, and activity.

## Why Logs Matter in Security
Logs allow analysts to detect suspicious behavior and reconstruct what happened during an incident.

## Example Log Events
- Normal log event: A system update occurring during scheduled maintenance.
- Suspicious log event: A scheduled task being disabled, which could indicate an attempt to evade monitoring.

## Questions I Have
- If suspicious things can happen at any time of the day, do SOC analysts always have to stay alert or on call?
