# Lesson 1 – Incident Basics

## What I Learned 
An alert is a sign that something unusual happened, but an incident means there is real or likely harm such as unauthorized access or data risk.

## Example Alert vs Incident
- Alert example: someone getting their password right on the 4th attempt after 3 failed attempts
- Incident example: A person getting their password right after 3 failed attempts and the login is in a different country”

## Why This Matters
Not every alert should be treated as an incident because security teams must focus on events that have real impact.

## Questions I Have
- If companies get thousands of alerts per day how likely is it for a real attack to be missed?
