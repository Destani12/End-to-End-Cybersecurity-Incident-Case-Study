# Lesson 3 – Network Basics

## What Network Traffic Is
Network traffic is the data sent between computers when they communicate.

## Example of Normal Network Activity
- Normal network activity is data being sent between systems during regular tasks like browsing the web, checking email, or system updates.

## Example of Suspicious Network Activity
- Suspicious network activity could include a large amount of data being transferred at once, especially if it is sent to an unusual or unknown destination.

## Why Network Traffic Matters in an Incident
- Network traffic matters because when a system communicates in a way that is out of character, it can indicate unauthorized activity or data exfiltration.
